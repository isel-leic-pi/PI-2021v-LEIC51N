Drawing sustenance from the unforgiving landscape of the north offers enough challenges, but whomever takes up this task must also man and defend the Wall against the onslaught of Wildlings fighting their way into Westeros.

When any child stops beside a resource that they need, they can load the resource into their wagon. When your wagon is full, you get to build a new house. The house must be placed in the right spot in the village. Then the resources are returned to the board so they can be collected again. After you build all your houses, you begin collecting resources again to build the Town Hall. The player who builds the Town Hall wins the game. Of course, children are also encouraged to play with the wonderful wooden buildings by themselves, and to create their own games and adventures in Catan.
